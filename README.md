## IMPORTANT NOTE

This repo is still in development! You may look for now but until I give the signal, it could change at any moment!

## Development

To run it locally, create a virtual environment

```
python3.6 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



git push heroku master && heroku logs --tail
